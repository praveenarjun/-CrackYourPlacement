Hint



Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]



solution:
soting with linear time

class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int second=nums.length-1, zero=0;
            for (int i=0; i<=second; i++) { //tracking through out the loop and comparing with each other 

                while (nums[i]==2 && i<second){ // if any start element is ==2 and pointer is not in last then replace it with last and move last to last-1
                    int temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = nums[second];
                    nums[second] = temp ;
                    second--;
                };
                while (nums[i]==0 && i>zero) { if any start element is ==0 and pointer is not in start then replace it with first and move first to first+1
                    int temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = nums[zero];
                    nums[zero] = temp ;
                    zero++;
                };
          }
    }
};
